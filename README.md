# TwitterNFTSalesBot

### About

The is a javascript implementation for a Twitter Solana NFT collection sales bot. It monitors secondary marketplaces for sales from a given collection and tweets about them. As of now, the bot only monitors Magic Eden, but functionality for other marketplaces is on the way.

Along with the bot comes a [Collection Fetcher](https://github.com/SecretDuckSociety/TwitterNFTSalesBot/blob/main/CollectionFetcher.js) that will generate a json file of the metadata from your NFT collection. Here is an example of the format the metadata for each NFT comes in.
```
    "id": 1968,
    "updateAuthority": "8yvshU8TYtg3c5TwmvJEzRRUgRGZSuWkghv1ZXP9UQUb",
    "mint": "Ezp7t9Mg1yuAu37AV7WAKTVjEGDhmF2beZm31imTdoR4",
    "name": "Duck #1968",
    "uri": "https://arweave.net/jZiFIUvG8cS9nAgiJ34mKxjGmvO8mfdKHsNaD4hEjhA",
    "address": "376bvNdBLagKgqmL7RcWnL3DeCUgk1ND2b4GRnc5NAKj"
```
Note that the Collection Fetcher assumes your collections includes '#*number*' somewhere in the NFT names. This is used to generate the id field in the metadata. If your NFT collection does not follow this naming pattern, adjust the code accordingly to change/remove the id field.

The scanner works by monitoring the address of a given marketplace. It continously uses the function [getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html#getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2) to pull a list of the recent transactions for that address, and then filters these for transactions that are sales involving the desired NFT collection. 

If the scanner detects a sale from the collection, it passes the appropriate information to [Tweet.js](https://github.com/SecretDuckSociety/TwitterNFTSalesBot/blob/main/Tweet.js) to handle Twitter functionality.

### Prerequisites
You must download some prerequisite software to be able to run this code:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

And set up [Twitter Developer Accounts](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/SecretDuckSociety/TwitterNFTSalesBot.git
yarn install
```

### How to run the bot

1. Fill in your .env file with the appropriate values. Note that due to rate limits, if you try to use the public endpoints (https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com) for RPC_ENDPOINT you will likely be throttled. To use the current iteration of the code you need to use a custom endpoint that doesn't include rate limits.
2. Visit the [constants file](https://github.com/SecretDuckSociety/TwitterNFTSalesBot/blob/main/utils/Constants.js) and change the NUM_CREATORS variable to match the number of creators for your collection. Your candy machine counts as a creator.
3. Run `node -r dotenv/config CollectionFetcher.js` to fetch the metadata associated with your collection.
4. Run `node -r dotenv/config Scanner.js` to fire up the bot. It will keep running until the process is killed (ctrl-c). Using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) to run your bot is recommended. Alternatively, you could run it as a Heroku app (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote)).
